# Loading Animations Gallery 

A growing collection of simple, creative loading animations built with HTML and CSS (and later some with JavaScript).  
This gallery is meant to be both **a visual reference** and **a hands-on practice playground**.

## Folder Structure

All loading animations are organized by **type** and **difficulty level**:

```
Loading-Animations-Gallery/
├── simple/
│   ├── circle/
│   ├── dot/
│   ├── line/
│   ├── square/
│   ├── wave/
│   ├──  loading-bar/
│   └── ......
├── medium/               ← coming soon (with some JavaScript)
├── hard/                 ← coming later
└── .devcontainer/        ← for VSCode Dev Containers
```

Each subfolder contains standalone `.html` demo files.  
No build setup required — just open in your browser!

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
3. View the animation and inspect the code to learn how it works.
4. Optionally, modify it and create your own version!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loading-Animations-Gallery.git
```

> You can also use the built-in `.devcontainer` to open the project directly in a pre-configured VSCode environment.

## Who Might Find This Useful?

This is a small personal project created for learning and practicing HTML/CSS animations.
If you're also exploring frontend development and want to experiment with visual effects, this might give you some ideas or a starting point.

You're very welcome to browse, reuse, or modify any part of it.

## What's Included？

This project includes basic examples using:

- `@keyframes`
- `transform`, `translate`, `scale`
- `transition` and `animation-delay`
- layout and timing tricks (like using `nth-child` or staggered delays)

Each animation is kept as simple and self-contained as possible.  
As I keep learning, I’ll also add more complex versions (with JavaScript) to the `medium/` or `hard/` folders later on.


## 🌈 Sample Gallery (WIP)

Here are a few of the animations included:

| Loader Type     | Demo                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| Spinner    | <img src="gifs/spinner-07.gif" height="80" /> |
| Pulsing Dot     | <img src="gifs/pulsing-dot.gif" height="80" /> |
| Heartbeat Line  | <img src="gifs/heartbeat.gif" height="80" /> |
| Wave Loader  | <img src="gifs/wave-bar.gif" height="80" /> |


## Notes

- All animations in the `simple/` folder are **pure HTML + CSS**.
- `medium/` and `hard/` folders will include JavaScript-based effects (e.g. canvas, interactive loaders).
- Animations are named clearly and grouped by type for easy browsing.
